# Introduction to Real-time Spatial Audio and Streaming for Game Engines | Dolby.io CodeLab

Users expect immersive experiences that can not only be entertaining but create engagement and retention.
Up until now, most immersive audio experiences within game engines has been based on a pre-production and static asset workflow. Developers and creators would need to script and pre-produce complex audio expereinces to playback at runtime. 

In this Dolby.io CodeLab, we will explore building Real-time Spatial Audio and Streaming experiences with the Unity and Unreal game engines. 

This workshop will explore how to build and include the Dolby.io communications and Streaming APIs within your experiences. These hands-on sections explore extending this environment to include live streaming media and communications between participants in that metaverse environment. For real-time interactivity with sub-second latency we'll cover some of the same techniques with WebRTC being used by major companies for broadcast quality workflows.

This repo contains all the information to get started with the APIs and Plugins.  As with previous Dolby.io CodeLabs our tutorial modeules will be served from a documentation server maintained in this repo.  Simply install and run the Documentation server to get started.  This workshop will also contain several web demos to enable interaction with the APIs directly.  Simply run the Dev Server to launch those demo applications. 

This workshop was first presented at MIT Reality Hack 2023, it's a living resource for getting started with Dolby.io Game Engine technologies and Plugins.  The community is invited to participate by writing additional modules and content via submitting pull requests; in fact, community members that contribute to this repo and write about it may be eligible for compensation.
